  abstract = {The detection of ultra-high-energy ({UHE}, ≥10 {PeV}) neutrinos via detectors designed to utilize the Askaryan effect has been a long-time goal of the astroparticle physics community. The Askaryan effect describes radio-frequency radiation from high-energy cascades. When a {UHE} neutrino initiates a cascade, cascade properties are imprinted on the radiation. Thus, observed radiation properties must be used to reconstruct the {UHE} neutrino event. Analytic Askaryan models have three advantages when used for {UHE} neutrino reconstruction. First, cascade properties may be derived from the match between analytic function and observed data. Second, analytic models minimize computational intensity in simulation packages. Third, analytic models can be embedded in firmware to enhance the real-time sensitivity of detectors. We present a fully analytic Askaryan model in the time domain for {UHE} neutrino-induced cascades in dense media that builds upon prior models in the genre. We then show that our model matches semianalytic parametrizations used in Monte Carlo simulations for the design of {IceCube}-Gen2. We find correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 and fractional power differences <5\% between the fully analytic and semianalytic approaches.},

  abstract = {The Askaryan effect describes coherent electromagnetic radiation from high-energy cascades in dense media with a collective charge. We present an analytic model of Askaryan radiation that accounts simultaneously for the three-dimensional form factor of the cascade, and quantum mechanical cascade elongation via the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal effect. These calculations, and the associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally intensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations. Searches for cosmogenic neutrinos in Askaryan-based detectors benefit from computational speed, because scans of Askaryan parameter-space are required to match neutrino signals. The Askaryan field is derived from cascade equations verified with Geant4 simulations, and compared with prior numerical and semi-analytic calculations. Finally, instructive cases of the model are transformed from the Fourier domain to the time-domain. Next-generation in situ detectors like {ARA} and {ARIANNA} can use analytic time-domain signal models to search for correlations with event candidates.},

Cosmic-ray-induced electromagnetic showers are a primary application. While many studies have treated the phenomenon approximately, none have attempted to incorporate all the physical scales involved in problems with time- or spatially evolving charges. We find it is possible to decompose the calculated fields into the product of a form factor, characterizing a moving charge distribution, multiplying a general integral which depends on the charge evolution. In circumstances of interest for cosmic ray physics, the resulting expressions can be evaluated explicitly in terms of a few parameters obtainable from shower codes. The classic issues of Fraunhofer and Fresnel zones play a crucial role in the coherence.},

abstract = {{The observation of electromagnetic radiation from radio to \$\textbackslashgamma\$-ray wavelengths has provided a wealth of information about the universe. However, at PeV (10\$\textasciicircum\{15\}\$ eV) energies and above, most of the universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the most extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the universe. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes and environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2 is designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV energies; 2) Investigate cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger observations; 3) Reveal the sources and propagation of the highest energy particles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with high-energy neutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic neutrinos by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect sources five times fainter than its predecessor. Furthermore, through the addition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the energy range by several orders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years and cost about \textbackslash\$350M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033. IceCube-Gen2 will play an essential role in shaping the new era of multi-messenger astronomy, fundamentally advancing our knowledge of the high-energy universe. This challenging mission can be fully addressed only in concert with the new survey instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational wave detectors which will be available in the coming years.}},
