  abstract = {The detection of ultra-high-energy ({UHE}, ≥10 {PeV}) neutrinos via detectors designed to utilize the Askaryan effect has been a long-time goal of the astroparticle physics community. The Askaryan effect describes radio-frequency radiation from high-energy cascades. When a {UHE} neutrino initiates a cascade, cascade properties are imprinted on the radiation. Thus, observed radiation properties must be used to reconstruct the {UHE} neutrino event. Analytic Askaryan models have three advantages when used for {UHE} neutrino reconstruction. First, cascade properties may be derived from the match between analytic function and observed data. Second, analytic models minimize computational intensity in simulation packages. Third, analytic models can be embedded in firmware to enhance the real-time sensitivity of detectors. We present a fully analytic Askaryan model in the time domain for {UHE} neutrino-induced cascades in dense media that builds upon prior models in the genre. We then show that our model matches semianalytic parametrizations used in Monte Carlo simulations for the design of {IceCube}-Gen2. We find correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 and fractional power differences <5\% between the fully analytic and semianalytic approaches.},

  abstract = {The Askaryan effect describes coherent electromagnetic radiation from high-energy cascades in dense media with a collective charge. We present an analytic model of Askaryan radiation that accounts simultaneously for the three-dimensional form factor of the cascade, and quantum mechanical cascade elongation via the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal effect. These calculations, and the associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally intensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations. Searches for cosmogenic neutrinos in Askaryan-based detectors benefit from computational speed, because scans of Askaryan parameter-space are required to match neutrino signals. The Askaryan field is derived from cascade equations verified with Geant4 simulations, and compared with prior numerical and semi-analytic calculations. Finally, instructive cases of the model are transformed from the Fourier domain to the time-domain. Next-generation in situ detectors like {ARA} and {ARIANNA} can use analytic time-domain signal models to search for correlations with event candidates.},

  abstract = {Radio Cherenkov emission underlies the detection of high energy particles via a signal growing like the particle energy squared. Cosmic-ray-induced electromagnetic showers are a primary application. While many studies have treated the phenomenon approximately, none have attempted to incorporate all the physical scales involved in problems with time- or spatially evolving charges. We find it is possible to decompose the calculated fields into the product of a form factor, characterizing a moving charge distribution, multiplying a general integral which depends on the charge evolution. In circumstances of interest for cosmic ray physics, the resulting expressions can be evaluated explicitly in terms of a few parameters obtainable from shower codes. The classic issues of Fraunhofer and Fresnel zones play a crucial role in the coherence.},
