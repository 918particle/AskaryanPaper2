  abstract = {The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt ({TeV}) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1-3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by {KM}3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of 12 0 - 60 + 110 petaelectronvolts ({PeV}). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5-7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.},

We searched for neutrino emission using machine learning techniques applied to 10 years of data from the {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory. By comparing diffuse emission models to a background-only hypothesis, we identified neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5σ level of significance.

Whereas this energy scale is out of reach for currently operating and future planned particle accelerators, natural astrophysical phenomena are expected to produce antineutrinos with energies beyond the {PeV} scale. Here we report the detection by the {IceCube} neutrino observatory of a cascade of high-energy particles (a particle shower) consistent with being created at the Glashow resonance. A shower with an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 {PeV} (determined from Cherenkov radiation in the Antarctic Ice Sheet) was measured. Features consistent with the production of secondary muons in the particle shower indicate the hadronic decay of a resonant W− boson, confirm that the source is astrophysical and provide improved directional localization. The evidence of the Glashow resonance suggests the presence of electron antineutrinos in the astrophysical flux, while also providing further validation of the standard model of particle physics. Its unique signature indicates a method of distinguishing neutrinos from antineutrinos, thus providing a way to identify astronomical accelerators that produce neutrinos via hadronuclear or photohadronic interactions, with or without strong magnetic fields. As such, knowledge of both the flavour (that is, electron, muon or tau neutrinos) and charge (neutrino or antineutrino) will facilitate the advancement of neutrino astronomy. A particle shower detected by the {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory at the very high energy of the Glashow resonance demonstrates its potential for the study of high-energy particle physics and astrophysics.},

The highest-energy event observed has a reconstructed muon energy of which implies a probability of less than for this event to be of atmospheric origin. Analyzing the arrival directions of all events with reconstructed muon energies above no correlation with known γ-ray sources was found.

However, at PeV (10\$\textasciicircum\{15\}\$ eV) energies and above, most of the universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the most extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the universe. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes and environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2 is designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV energies; 2) Investigate cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger observations; 3) Reveal the sources and propagation of the highest energy particles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with high-energy neutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic neutrinos by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect sources five times fainter than its predecessor. Furthermore, through the addition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the energy range by several orders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years and cost about \textbackslash\$350M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033. IceCube-Gen2 will play an essential role in shaping the new era of multi-messenger astronomy, fundamentally advancing our knowledge of the high-energy universe. This challenging mission can be fully addressed only in concert with the new survey instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational wave detectors which will be available in the coming years.}},

The longitudinal development of extreme energy cosmic ray showers has a characteristic “Universal Shower Profile” when normalized and translated to the shower maximum. Experimentally accessible observables can be defined to parametrize the average shape and characterize each event. By describing the full shape of the profile, information related to the first hadronic interactions and primary particle type can be extracted. A shape variable which measures the distance from the first interaction to the depth of maximum can lead to a cosmic ray composition analysis with independent extraction of the primary cross-sections.}

While this measurement has clear radioglaciological applications, the radio clarity of the ice also has implications for the detection of ultra-high energy (UHE) astrophysical particles via their radio emission in dielectric media such as ice.

The neutrino production rate can be constrained through the accompanying electrons, positrons and gamma-rays that quickly cascade on the CMB and intergalactic magnetic fields to lower energies and generate a γ-ray background in the GeV–TeV region. Bethe–Heitler pair production by protons also contributes to the cascade and can tighten the neutrino constraints in models where extragalactic cosmic rays begin to dominate over the galactic component at a relatively low “crossover” energy. We investigate this issue in the light of the recent Fermi-LAT measurements of the diffuse extragalactic γ-ray background and illustrate by a fit to the HiRes spectrum how the prediction of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in all-proton models varies with the crossover energy. The neutrino flux is required to be smaller when the gamma-ray bound is applied, nevertheless such models are still consistent with HiRes and Fermi-LAT if one properly takes into account the energy uncertainty of cosmic ray measurements.

These calculations, and the associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally intensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations.

The Askaryan field is derived from cascade equations verified with Geant4 simulations, and compared with prior numerical and semi-analytic calculations.

However, confidently reconstructing the radio signals can pose a challenge, as they are often obscured by background noise. Information Field Theory offers a robust approach to this challenge by using Bayesian inference to calculate the most likely radio signal, given the recorded data.

abstract = {Owing to their small interaction cross-section, neutrinos are unparalleled astronomical tracers. Ultra-high energy (UHE; E >  10 PeV) neutrinos probe the most distant, most explosive sources in the Universe, often obscured to optical telescopes. Radio-frequency (RF) detection of Askaryan radiation in cold polar ice is currently regarded as the best experimental measurement technique for UHE neutrinos, provided the RF properties of the ice target can be well-understood. To that end, the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment at the South Pole has used long-baseline RF propagation to extract information on the index-of-refraction (n=ϵr) in South Polar ice. Owing to the increasing ice density over the upper 150–200 m, rays are measured along two, nearly parallel paths, one of which refracts through an inflection point, with differences in both arrival time and arrival angle that can be used to constrain the neutrino properties. We also observe (first) indications for RF ice birefringence for signals propagating along predominantly horizontal trajectories, corresponding to an asymmetry of order 0.1% between the ordinary and extra-ordinary birefringent axes, numerically compatible with previous measurements of birefringent asymmetries for vertically-propagating radio-frequency signals at South Pole. Qualitatively, these effects offer the possibility of redundantly measuring the range from receiver to a neutrino interaction in Antarctic ice, if receiver antennas are deployed at shallow (z ∼  −25 m) depths. Such range information is essential in determining both the neutrino energy, as well as the incident neutrino direction.}

UHE neutrinos may provide important clues to understanding the nature of cosmic-ray sources. ARIANNA aims to detect UHE neutrinos via radio (Askaryan) emission from particle showers when a neutrino interacts with ice, which is an efficient method for neutrinos with energies between 10\textasciicircum16 eV and 10\textasciicircum20 eV. The ARIANNA radio detectors are located in Antarctic ice just beneath the surface. Neutrino observation requires that radio pulses propagate to the antennas at the surface with minimum distortion by the ice and firn medium. Using the residual hole from the South Pole Ice Core Project, radio pulses were emitted from a transmitter located up to 1.7 km below the snow surface. By measuring these signals with an ARIANNA surface station, the angular and polarization reconstruction abilities are quantified, which are required to measure the direction of the neutrino. After deconvolving the raw signals for the detector response and attenuation from propagation through the ice, the signal pulses show no significant distortion and agree with a reference measurement of the emitter made in an anechoic chamber. Furthermore, the signal pulses reveal no significant birefringence for our tested geometry of mostly vertical ice propagation. The origin of the transmitted radio pulse was measured with an angular resolution of 0.37 degrees indicating that the neutrino direction can be determined with good precision if the polarization of the radio-pulse can be well determined. In the present study we obtained a resolution of the polarization vector of 2.7 degrees. Neither measurement show a significant offset relative to expectation.}},

abstract = {{Radio Cherenkov radiation is arguably the most efficient mechanism for detecting showers from ultrahigh energy particles of 1 PeV and above. Showers occurring in Antarctic ice should be detectable at distances up to 1 km. We report on electromagnetic shower development in ice using a GEANT Monte Carlo simulation. We have studied energy deposition by shower particles and determined shower parameters for several different media, finding agreement with published results where available. We also report on radio pulse emission from the charged particles in the shower, focusing on coherent emission at the Cherenkov angle. Previous work has focused on frequencies in the 100 MHz to 1 GHz range. Surprisingly, we find that the coherence regime extends up to tens of GHz. This may have substantial impact on future radio-based neutrino detection experiments as well as any test beam experiment which seeks to measure coherent Cherenkov radiation from an electromagnetic shower. Our study is particularly important for the RICE experiment at the South Pole.}},
